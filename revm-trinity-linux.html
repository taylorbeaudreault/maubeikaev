                            <p> Resolved! My Trinity runs on a slow Linux. Finally I installed Trinity on my fast Windows work PC, imported the seed - and: DID NOT SEE the transaction(s) made by the Linux Trinity. Seems to be a TrinityLinux Bug/to slow CPU. Now I Made a new transaction, promoted it and: it worked. Now the Linux Trinity shows the correct value - but also still the pending transactions. amp#x200B; Hi, I am trying to send a transaction (Gi-Size) with Trinity Desktop. Reattaching/Repeating fails: "Something. 
My son had 1-5 bitcoins in wallet hidden on a hard drive in 2012. The computer died a bit after, the drive seems to be missing some data. I posted about this here last week: everyone was great, very helpful. The consensus was that I need to image the old drive before running spinrite or other file recovery SW on the image to avoid further corrupting anything. So I bought a 2T usb drive to image the old 500Gig drive to. I have some technical background, but have never imaged a drive before. I’v. I'm looking for a distro recommendation to setup for someone with a low-end laptop. As much as I would like to just clone my set up (Arch with KDE Plasma), I'm smart enough to realize that the user has almost no technical expertise and their system is very minimal spec wise, meaning huge DEs (GNOME, KDE) may not be the best solution. The PC is only a few years old and is running Windows 10 (kinda slowly), so nothing is really out of the running, however the specs being low, performance Howdy y'all. I have a Naga Trinity that worked really well with my macintosh and Windows systems. I started using Manjaro Linux a couple of months back and now my profiles aren't working, even the ones I have saved to the mouse itself. Any ideas on either a) when there'll be a release of synapse for Linux or b) how I can custom access the drivers and change rob values to static manually? It's really bothersome that they cycle constantly. Hi, i created a simple guide for those who dont want buy a hardware wallet but still would like to feel secure no one will steal his IOTA's https://iotashine.com/how-to-install-trinity-iota-wallet-in-linux/ (https://iotashine.com/how-to-install-trinity-iota-wallet-in-linux/). The new Trinity wallet for IOTA on desktop is amazing! I am happy to see that we have another wallet. The old one was lagy at times. We just need the Ledger wallet to be adopted and nothing can stop IOTA anymore. I could not install the Trinity desktop on Linux Debian. What could be happening? Thanks. Stupid question but all the updates are for desktop, cross platform, and mobile which I’m assuming means windows, Mac, phone. 
Just update NSS by this command: sudo apt-get install libnss3. Any of you guys have any recommendations for a Linux distro on the x61? Using Manjaro with i3, not toally I swear to christ that Optimus was forged in the depths of hell by an Nvidia engineer hellbent on punishing Linux users for owning a laptop. Arch refuses to let the non-free drivers work with the PRIME switcher for whatever reason meaning I have to use Bumblebee. BB works fine except with Steam which seemed to have constant issues relating to libgl and driver problems. Steam worked perfectly on Mint due to PRIME but the non-free drivers had problems with the screen tearing more easily It's about time I throw some money at my dying ol' bastard of a PC. So, for comparison, I have a X3 Rana, HD 5700 amp 4GB DDR2 RAM so anything is an upgrade for me. I only really play AoE2 amp New Vegas at the moment but I'd like to try out FO4, GTAV, Witcher 3, Skyrim SE amp Project CARS . I don't need ULTRA settings or constant 1080p@60fps, I'm just not picky about that and going from my current build, I'm not into having the best of the best or anything luxury. I'm in Canada As the title is stating I can't open the terminal at all. I get the loading circle and then it just stops and nothing happens. I have tried to search the forums for solutions but I can't find any. I am currently using cinnamon 18.1 64-bit on a HP Probook 645. Cinnamon Version is 3.2.7 and the linux Kernal is 4.4.0-70-generic Edit: I still can't use the gnome-terminal, have tried to apply a fixs like seting the language. As a long time user, I love how some people think like I think: why fix something that is not broken? I love consistency and incremental improvements. Both KDE3 and GNOME2 followed that principle, and had matured into excellent desktops with very few problems and a solid code. Then KDE4 and Unity amp GNOME3 happened, and caused a massive outrage in a similar way Windows 8 is causing right now. Shortly after secession projects like MATE and Trinity were announced, which caused small-scale scand.
