                            <p> I'm about to start another trilogy playthrough and have my ME1 and ME3 modded up nicely with MEUITM and ALOT respectively but I cant find something for ME2. I just have a few high resolution textures but not many. Does anybody have some links to a texture pack that is at least somewhat substantial or similar to these other. 
I have tried a lot of methods, using Texmod and PCGaming Wiki's method but with theirs doesn't seem to be working and if it did work it would be incredibly tedious. So I was just wondering if anyone here has experience in this area and has gotten them working in the past and if you did, how you did it? It would be a great new years gift to me! Here is a link to PCGamingWiki's page with the method on it by the way, great read. (http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_2#Video_settings). I know that there is a details on the sidebar but I'm hoping someone can link me a decent texture mod, with a simple to use guide; much like the guide that was provided for the ME1 texture pack. Having the texture pack for the first game really enhanced my experience and I'd like the same for both ME2 and ME3. Any guidance will be greatly appreciated. I have an odd problem with the textures in me2. On my laptop (2.1Ghz dual core, 256MB Radeon 4570) I get mass effect 2's incredible character textures but, on my gaming rig (Phenom II 965, 1GB Radeon 5750) I'm stuck with textures worse than in mass effect 1. What gives? No matter what resolution I put me2 at on my gaming rig the textures are always lousy. The 'graphics' section in the configure utility are identical on the two pcs, latest drivers Could someone guide me on how to locate and extract the texture file for the Shuriken machine pistol? I've a basic understanding on how to use the Unreal Model Viewer, but I'm not sure where this file would be located inside of the CookedPC folder. I'll appreciate any sort of help Reddit has to offer. Reddit, could you guide me on how to extract the texture file for the Shuriken machine pistol? I've a basic understanding thus far on how to use the Unreal Model Viewer, but I'm not sure where in the CookedPC folder this file would be found. If anyone could help me in any way, I'd be much obliged. I have a seed-box and thought it would benefit everybody if I just created a torrent with all of the textures. I'll upgrade the torrent as we go. This is the main link for the Mass Effect 3 Textures ( This is the main link for the Mass Effect 2 Textures ( EDIT: I had to create a new torrent,RE-DOWNLOAD IT (http://www.mediafire.com/?dj1gq9bejg6d8dz). It took me about three days to figure this all out, but here's a guide to everything from fixing glitches, installing texture mods and getting the stupid DLC to work. Here's a link to someone else's guide (https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/7o6u0h/me2_no_spoilers_guide_for_my_current_modding/) if you want. He made some different changes. amp#x200B; # Downloads (some of these are optoinal) A Lot of Textures (ALOT) (https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect2/mods/68/) will seriously. 
I have a problem. I am running this at max settings (via the ME2 Configuration Utility, Video options) but there's no option for ultra-res textures. Everything looks fine but there are incredibly low-res textures on NPCs' clothing and whatnot. It's horrible looking. Is there any method to make the textures higher-res? Without mods if possible. Also I've set detail mode to 3 in collesced.ini. I've been playing Mass Effect 2 on 360 for years, and all of a sudden all of the darker textures are super dark, especially in dialogue screens. This has never happened to me before. Any ideas what it could. Does anyone have a copy? It's no longer on nexus: Looks like it has been hidden since: February 7, 2017. Or does anyone know of a similar/better 
I have a strange bug in Mass Effect 2 that I just can't seem to fix. I have mods installed now (to try and fix it sort of), but even without mods I get the bug. Here's some pics. The mods I'm currently using are Mass Effect Cheat Console, ME2Controller, A Lot Of Textures (ALOT) for ME2, and No MiniGames. Again I tried the game on a fresh install and still had the same bug. PC Specs: Win 10 64bit AMD Phenom II X4 965 Processor. Are there any Mass Effect 2 HD Texture mods still up on the internet? I just got it on PC and want to upgrade the textures. Every link that I've found is literally broken or taken down. If anyone has one and can dm it to me it'd be really appreciated! Thanks. As the title states: the texture overhaul has been hidden on nexusmods very recently and i was wondering if anyone has any news of when it may be back. I know the creator showed the mod on this subreddit before, perhaps he/she still lurks This is a list of games that can run (by which i mean atleast 30fps) on a pc with a 2gb RAM, and a dual core processor (which are also good). The aim of this post is to help people with potato pc find some games to play easily. Please keep in mind that I will include those games that I have played in my pc, so if you don't see a game you think is a good low end pc game, well maybe I just haven't played them yet. 1. Mass Effect trilogy : Man this series IS the deal. This series has no rights. 
The new version, with a much simpler install was published recently, but the file just went down on the Nexus for review. Anyone have it or its torrent. </p>
